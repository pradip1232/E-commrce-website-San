                Ayurveda is a science laid down by the great Indian rishis. The science of Ayurveda is not based on constantly changing research data rather; its roots lie in the eternal wisdom of our rishis and gurus. Ayurveda offers guidance that has been tested, refined and nourished over many centuries to all those who seek greater harmony, peace and longevity.
